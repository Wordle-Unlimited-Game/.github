## What is Wordle Unlimited?

Wordle Unlimited is an extended version of the classic Wordle game that allows players to enjoy endless word puzzles without the daily restriction of one game per day.

## How to Play Wordle Unlimited

- **Green**: The letter is in the right place.
- **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Gray**: The letter is not in the word at all.

With **Wordle Unlimited play**, you can keep going as long as you like, making it a fantastic way to practice and challenge yourself.
